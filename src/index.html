		<meta name="description" content= "Vung Tau is a popular weekend escape from Ho Chi Minh City, it rocks at weekends and holidays when beach-starved locals and expats descend in numbers, but it is relatively quiet during the week. The city enjoys a spectacular location on a peninsula in the south, with the ocean on three sides. The light and sea air make it a refreshing break from sultry Saigon.">
